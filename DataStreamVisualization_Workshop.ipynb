    "- Implement a **Dynamic Dashboard** using real-world data from one or more operational robots.\n",
    "- Build **Jupyter Notebooks** with well-structured code and clear Markdown documentation.\n",
    "- Use **Git and GitHub** for collaborative version control and code sharing.\n",
    "- Identify and articulate coding issues (\"**talking points**\") and insert them directly into peer notebooks.\n",
    "- Practice **collaborative debugging**, professional peer feedback, and improve code quality.\n",

    "## 🧩 Workshop Structure (180 Minutes)\n",
    "1. **Instructor Use Case Introduction** *(40 min)* – Set up teams of 3 people. Read and understand the workshop, plus submission instructions. Seek assistance if needed.\n",
    "2. **Team Jupyter Notebook Development** *(120 min)* – Collection, Persistence, and Dashboard coding + Markdown documentation (work as teams)\n",
    "3. **Push to GitHub** *(10 min)* – Teams commit and push initial notebooks. **Make sure to include your names so it is easy to identify the team that developed the Min-Max code**.\n",
    "4. **Instructor Review** - The instructor will go around, take notes, and provide coaching as needed, during the **Peer Review Round**\n",
    "5. **Email Delivery** *(5 min)* – Each team send the instructor an email **with the *.git link** to the GitHub repo **(one email/team)**. Subject on the email is: CSCN8010 - Data Stream Visualization Workshop, Team #_____.\n",
    "6. **Push to the course GitHub** *(automated)* – Find the last code cell in this notebook, update your team number, and run the cell. It will push your notebook to the repo at `submissions/team#`\n",
