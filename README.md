# Foundations of Machine Learning Frameworks
Workshop on Data Streaming and Visualization Workshop
Use case: Robot Predictive Maintenance

In this hands-on session, you and your team will build an **Predictive Maintenance Dashboard** application, the visibility tool of an Anomaly Detection and response management workflow in a manufacturing facility.

Purpose: Robot Predicative Maintenance tool that collects electrical load data for each joint and other relevant data, then applies Machine Learning to set standard operating patterns and identify anomalies.

The target is to **predict equipment failure** by using a condition monitoring system based on the collection of a robot’s power measurements and the detection of errors and inaccuracies based on electricity and torque data analysis.
